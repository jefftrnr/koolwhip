Overview 
Koolwhip delivers rock, blues, mashups, some manic country and a lot of fun guaranteed to launch a party on the spot! Fronted by Aussie diva Sally Dominguez with epic bass by surf band meister Jeff Turner, the renowned Jim Lehmann on drums, Steve Michel tearing up lead guitar and Brian McDaniel holding it together on rhythm, Koolwhip are a local favorite, a crowd-pleaser with that special sauce. Marin-based, we gig around the Bay Area.


Known for our unexpected mashups of rock, funk and pop, we also write our own tunes that range from power funk and blues to punk country hillbilly rock. A typical set might launch with Hush, roll into Black DogHouse or Roxanne Dancing in the White Room, and pepper with Separate Metal Jacket (who knew Journey and Metallica were besties?) and Sesame Biscuit, thus hooking you on our infectious music.


We are a bunch of Marin locals – well OK, Sally is a blow-in from Australia but she lives here now. We’ve played together since 2014, connecting with joy as a band and with our audiences! All of us play with other bands…but everybody secretly knows that Koolwhip is the best. ……
Drummer Jim is our beatkeeper and gatemaster…..and when he’s not plumbin’ he's drummin’! ‘Nuff said! He’s significant and well known around Marin venues. Steve Michel is on Lead guitar. He’s mild mannered in appearance, but get the straight-jacket ready when he solos. He's like the quiet neighbor who keeps to himself. Dangerous. Stealthy. Unpredictable EXCEPT when he solos - that's predictably ON!
Jeff steers his electric bass through the funk / rock / jazz / blues /surf landscape with masterful purpose and groove, most recently for P B & Jam, Frankie and the Pool Boys, Pollo Del Mar and as an upright bassist for Rick Hatfield and The Jumpin' Bobcats. Be warned: Jeff’s bass riffs will sneak up and knock you sideways….into Brian, percussive and explosive on rhythm guitar.
Take a close look at Brian – tonight could be the night he is playing with his homemade Titanium pick. Or is it the coconut shell one? Brian is a maker musician playing rhythm guitar with lots of unexpected twists and turns. 
Sally makes lots of turns too…whether it's off-road rallying, tearing up the dance floor or just turning it up to Eleven for the heck of it. A raspy belter with a heart o’ gold, Sally will do her utmost to ensure that her Aussie accent doesn’t get in the way of a good song.

Emphasizing melody, grooves, and fun—without “dumb lyrics”—the band draws from first-wave beach music while incorporating exotica, psychedelia, and global influences.

Brian McDaniel 
is a rhythm guitarist whose blues-infused, funky riffs and playful, inventive style have entertained and maybe bemused Marin County’s funk and rock scene for over 15 years. Hailing from San Rafael in Marin County, California, Brian blends funk rock, post punk and sometimes roots reggae influences with experimental flair. Rumors are true, he makes his own picks (example: titanium, cow hoof, coconut shell, tagua nut, old spatula, street signs) to add texture to his playing.
Brian co-founded Koolwhip, the high-energy Marin County funk-rock band, in 2014 with a few very talented Marin musicians who are now long-time, dear friends. As part of the band’s rhythmic backbone, Brian helps drive the ensemble—featuring powerhouse vocalist Sally Dominguez, bassist Jeff Turner, drummer Jim Lehmann, and guitarist Steve Michel, through infectious un-covers, mashups and originals that fuse funk, rock, punk country hillbilly rock, soul and pop. Koolwhip’s electrifying sets have lit up venues and events all around the Bay Area, but mostly embracing Marin’s vibrant, community-rooted scene. Exploring his musical connection with a drive to give it his all, it has been said (probably only by Sally) that Brian embodies the “maker musician” ethos, crafting performances that resonate with groove, soul and heart.
