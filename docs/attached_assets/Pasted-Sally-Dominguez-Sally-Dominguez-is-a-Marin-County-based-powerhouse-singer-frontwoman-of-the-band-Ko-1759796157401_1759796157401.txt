Music Career
Sally Dominguez is a dynamic vocalist and songwriter whose soulful voice and infectious energy have made her a staple of Marin County’s vibrant music scene. An Australian-born singer-songwriter and performer whose Marin County music career took root after relocating to the Bay Area in the early 2010s, Sally channels her adventurous spirit into performances that blend funk, rock, pop mashups, and heartfelt originals, captivating audiences at local festivals, wine bars, and intimate venues across the North Bay.
At the forefront of her musical journey is Koolwhip, the high-octane Bay Area funk-rock ensemble formed in 2014, blending energetic rock, blues, mashups, and power funk with hillbilly rock. Formed by Marin locals, Koolwhip delivers groove-driven sets that fuse classic covers with innovative twists and Sally’s own compositions, earning them a devoted following for their dance-floor anthems. Sally fronts Koolwhip alongside bandmates Brian McDaniel, Jeff Turner, Jim Lehmann, and Steve Michel. From headlining multiple Corte Madera Oktoberfests to rocking stages at Big Rock Cafe, Travis Marina, Tam Commons, 19 Broadway, Deer Park Villa, corporate and private parties, and Youth in Arts fundraisers, Koolwhip exemplifies the inspired, high energy and electrifying vibe of Marin music, with Sally’s powerful vocals and stage presence lighting up every show.


Complementing her work with Koolwhip, Sally shines in the acoustic realm as half of Sal-n-Rich, the charming duo she shares with guitarist Richard Benyon. Specializing in nostalgic takes on 1980s hits, Sal-n-Rich brings a warm, unplugged intimacy to events like the Schurig Center for Brain Injury Recovery’s BAM Gala and sunset sessions at Zinz Wine Bar. Their chemistry is born from shared love of melody and storytelling and offers a softer counterpoint to Koolwhip’s high-energy romps, showcasing Sally’s versatility as a performer who can whisper a ballad or belt a chorus with equal finesse.
