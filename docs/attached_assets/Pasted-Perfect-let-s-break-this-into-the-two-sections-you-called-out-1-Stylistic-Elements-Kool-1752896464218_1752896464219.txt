Perfect — let’s break this into the two sections you called out:

🎨 1. Stylistic Elements — Kool Whip’s Visual & Emotional Signature

The site should look like the music feels. Kool Whip isn’t a generic rock band — the name screams flavor, fun, and retro-slick energy. Here’s how to bring that out visually and emotionally:

🎷 Aesthetic Style:
	•	Palette:
	•	Base: Creamy whites, chocolate browns, rich purples.
	•	Accents: Electric blue, bubblegum pink, gold foil.
	•	Think: whipped cream meets disco funk.
	•	Fonts:
	•	Logo-style title font: chunky, bubbly, or 70s-inspired (e.g. Shrikhand, Monoton, Bungee).
	•	Body text: sleek and legible (e.g. Work Sans, Open Sans, Raleway).
	•	Texture & Shapes:
	•	Rounded elements, pill-shaped buttons.
	•	Subtle textures: vinyl grooves, analog TV fuzz, whipped cream swirls in backgrounds.
	•	Hover states should be buttery smooth (no sharp corners or janky transitions).
	•	Motion & Animation:
	•	Scroll-based parallax effects.
	•	Animated transitions between sections (e.g. bouncing “Join the List” button).
	•	Live elements like a pulsing “Now Playing” bar if music is featured on the homepage.
	•	Imagery:
	•	Studio and stage photos in warm tones, film grain style.
	•	Funky photoshoots: matching outfits, staged album covers, playful portraits.
	•	Album art should blend seamlessly into the layout.
	•	Logo Placement:
	•	Top left on all pages — consistent branding.
	•	Footer should repeat logo + social media icons in one unified visual block.
