Absolutely. Based on everything you’ve told me, here’s an extrapolated, full-throttle vision of what you (and Kool Whip) would likely want for this band website — even beyond what you may have said out loud. Think of this as a creative director’s master brief:

⸻

🎤 Kool Whip Website Vision: “The Flavor That Sticks”

⸻

🌐 Overall Vibe
	•	Aesthetics: Funky-retro meets modern clean — vibrant, nostalgic, yet polished. Think Parliament-Funkadelic meets a Squarespace template done right.
	•	Tone: Playful but professional. Confident musicianship with personality.
	•	Responsive: Built mobile-first with snappy animations, parallax scroll, and buttery-smooth transitions.
	•	Fast loading. SEO-optimized. Social-ready.
