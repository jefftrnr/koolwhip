Jeff Turner is a versatile and exciting bassist based in Marin County, California, renowned in the Bay Area’s funk rock, vibrant instrumental surf and blues rock scenes. With a playing style that seamlessly blends exciting percussive, melodic, harmony rich  bass lines with masterful upright grooves, Turner is a cornerstone of several influential bands, contributing to hundreds of live performances, international tours, and a string of acclaimed recordings. His work often fuses classic surf twang with progressive psychedelic elements, jazz-inflected rhythms, and high-energy party vibes, earning him a reputation as a “low-end rocket launch pad” among his many collaborators. A Marin local through and through, Turner’s deep roots in the North Bay music community have seen him anchor acts that headline festivals from Italy to Japan while keeping the local music circuit humming.
Jeff’s emergence in the mid-1990s aligns with the huge “Third Wave” of surf revival, inspired by Bay Area pioneers like The Mermen and The Aqua Velvets. As a bassist, he quickly distinguished himself with a wide dynamic range, capable of delivering stealthy, sideways-knocking riffs in rock and surf contexts or steady, purposeful lines in jazz-bluegrass hybrids. Jeff is a go-to player for regional venues, from Sweetwater Music Hall in Mill Valley to Sonoma County stages, where his bands consistently draw crowds for their toe-tapping mashups and infectious energy.
Band Highlights
Koolwhip ( 2014–present)
 In this high-octane funk rock party band out of Corte Madera, Turner handles “epic bass” duties, steering electric lines through rock, blues, funk, mashups, manic country and originals designed to “launch a party on the spot.” Koolwhip thrives on Turner’s masterful grooves across genres, from funky nibblet rhythms to thoughtfully improvised solos. Turner’s surprising melodies and riffs “sneak up and knock you sideways,” making him one of the favorite bassmen in Marin..

Pollo Del Mar (1993–2012, reunited 2020–present)
 Turner joined this San Francisco-born instrumental surf powerhouse early on, providing the “powerhouse rhythm section” backbone alongside drummer Jeremy Rexford (and earlier, Chris Thomas). Co-led by guitarists Ferenc Dobronyi and Jono Jones, Pollo Del Mar blended reverb-soaked Fender twang with atmospheric feedback, prog-rock layers, and spaghetti western flair. Turner appeared on all four studio albums, including the genre-bending The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (1999), featuring covers like “Apache ‘99” and originals such as “Devil’s Slide”; The Golden State (2004), with cinematic tracks like “A Flash of Green” and “Mare Amniotica”; and the long-awaited reunion LP Speed of Dark (2023), recorded amid COVID downtime and praised for its psych-guitar interplay and vigorous low-end drive. The band toured Japan and Europe twice, headlining Italy’s Surfer Joe Festival, and contributed to 26 compilations, including Frank Zappa tributes. After retiring in 2012 for side projects, they reunited for Speed of Dark‘s vinyl release, cementing Pollo’s status as a Third Wave leader.


Frankie and the Pool Boys (2007–present)
 Originally a side project of Pollo Del Mar members, this instrumental surf combo evolved into a standalone force with Turner on bass, alongside Ferenc Dobronyi (guitar/leader), Jono Jones (guitar), Karen Dobronyi (keyboards), and rotating drummers like Dusty Watson and Jonathan Rodriguez. Emphasizing melody, grooves, and fun—without “dumb lyrics”—the band draws from first-wave beach music while incorporating exotica, psychedelia, and global influences. Turner features on their four CDs of originals: the eclectic debut Frankie and the Pool Boys (2008), with tracks like “Ewa on the Beach” and a surf-twisted “Pomp and Circumstance”; The Adventures of Cap’n Coconuts (2013), evoking tiki adventures; and the guest-packed Endless Drummer (2025), blending dub, garage rock, and explosive surf with contributions from international surf luminaries. They’ve toured Europe (headlining Surfer Joe), Mexico (Baja Surf Stomp), and Japan, playing quiet tiki lounges to raucous festivals, always delivering “big smiles and a good time.”
